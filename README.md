# 🎨 Paint with Linked List

👋 Hello, there! This repository contains a simple **Paint-like application** developed using **Windows Forms**, **C#**, and a **Linked List** data structure to manage the figures drawn by the user. The project was created as part of a school assignment to showcase basic drawing functionality similar to Microsoft's Paint, but using linked lists to store shapes.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🖌️ **Draw basic shapes** like lines, rectangles, ellipses, and more.
- 🗂️ **Linked List implementation** to store and manage drawn figures.
- ⏪ **Undo/Redo** functionality based on Linked List traversal.
- 🖼️ Simple and intuitive **user interface** designed with Windows Forms.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- ⚙️ **C#**: The primary language for developing the application.
- 📊 **Windows Forms**: Used to design the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- 🔗 **Linked List**: To store and manage the shapes drawn by the user.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. ⬇️ **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paint-clone.git
    ```

2. 📂 Open the project in **Visual Studio**.

3. 🔄 Make sure all dependencies are restored, then **build** and **run** the solution.

4. 🖥️ The Paint-like application will open, and you can start drawing shapes!

## 🌳 Project Branching and Versioning

💡 This project was made when I was still learning how to use GitHub and version control systems. Instead of keeping the **latest version** of the project on the `main` branch, I used branches for each version. As a result, the **most up-to-date code is located in the last created branch**, not in the `main` branch.

### 🔍 Finding the Latest Version

1. 🖱️ Go to the **Branches** section of this repository.
2. 🔝 Look for the **last created branch**, which contains the final version of the project with all the latest features and updates.
3. 🔄 Checkout this branch or switch to it to access the most current code.

## 🧩 How the Project Works

🖊️ The application allows the user to select different drawing tools (line, rectangle, ellipse) and create these shapes on a canvas. The program stores each shape in a **Linked List**, which helps with navigating between the drawn objects for operations like **undo** and **redo**. The choice of Linked List helps manage the drawing sequence efficiently, with each node in the list representing a drawn figure.

## 📈 Future Improvements

I marked this project as done, so no future improvements are planned to be done. But who knows what the future has prepared to us.

🙌 I hope this project serves as a simple but effective demonstration of how to create a Paint-like application using **C#** and **Linked Lists**. Feel free to explore the code and improve upon it!
